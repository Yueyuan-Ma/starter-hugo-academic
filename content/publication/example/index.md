abstract: We estimate the effects of spousal labor supply on individuals’ labor
  supply by using the 1994-1995 initiation of China’s workweek reduction policy
  as a natural experiment. We find that a decrease in the labor supply of wives
  significantly increased the labor supply of husbands, but a decrease in the
  labor supply of husbands had an insignificantly negative effect on that of
  their wives. Furthermore, a decrease in the labor supply of one spouse reduced
  the amount of time spent on housework for both the husband and wife. Our
  findings of the negative relation between the labor supplies of spouses differ
  from findings based on data from developed countries. We find evidence that
  different income levels might be the underlying reason. The findings of this
  study suggest that more resources are needed to achieve the goals set by
  governments in developing countries.
